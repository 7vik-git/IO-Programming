### ðŸ“‚ I/O Streams, File Handling and CSV Files

This module covers Javaâ€™s Input/Output (I/O) Stream APIs and their usage in reading from and writing to files, particularly in CSV format. It demonstrates both byte streams and character streams, focusing on practical applications like file handling, buffered reading/writing, and structured data processing.

Key topics include:

* `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` for byte-level operations.
* `FileReader` and `FileWriter` for character-based file handling.
* `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for efficient I/O.
* Parsing and generating CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files using basic string manipulation or libraries like `OpenCSV`.
* Exception handling and best practices for resource management using `try-with-resources`.
